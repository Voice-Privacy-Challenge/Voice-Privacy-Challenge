# The VoicePrivacy ðŸŒŸ Attacker ðŸŒŸ Challenge is coming soon! #

We run a new VoicePrivacy **Attacker Challenge** that focuses on  developing  **attack models against speaker anonymization systems**.
A set of different anonymization systems, participated in the  VoicePrivacy 2022 Challenge, will be used for evaluation.
Participants should develop their attack models in the form of automatic speaker verification systems and submit their scores on the test and development data to the organizers.
